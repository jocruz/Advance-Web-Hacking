**📌 Prompt: Create Obsidian Exam-Ready Documentation from Transcript**

You are an expert documentation writer and Obsidian user. I will provide a full transcript from an advanced web hacking course video. Your task is to turn it into exam-ready documentation for Obsidian.

**Requirements:**

1. **Use all information** from the transcript. Do **not** omit any content.
    
2. **Rephrase and polish** the transcript while preserving the original meaning.
    
3. At the top of the document, include a **high-level summary** that outlines the key takeaways.
    
4. Format the content using **Obsidian Markdown syntax**:
    
    - Use `##` and `###` for clear section breakdowns
        
    - Use `> [!note]`, `> [!tip]`, `> [!warning]` callouts **only for high-value insights**
        
    - Format all code, tools, commands, and payloads using **syntax-highlighted code blocks**
        
5. Create a **dedicated “Tools Mentioned” section** at the end, including:
    
    - All tools mentioned in the transcript
        
    - Tools **implied** by the methodology, even if not named directly
        

**Context:**  
The output will be used in an **open-book exam**, so the content must be:

- Easy to scan
    
- Structured logically
    
- Rich in technical accuracy
    
- Free of emojis

Let me know if you'd like me to tailor this further or embed it into a reusable Notion or Obsidian template. When you're ready, paste the transcript.
