Here’s a refined prompt you can use:

---

**Prompt:**

I will share my Obsidian notes from an advanced web-hacking course. I’ve already passed the beta exam, and the open-book exam I’m preparing for is a live web-app penetration test. All vulnerabilities, attacks, and hints needed are covered in these notes.

Turn my notes into an **exam-ready strategy guide** that I can reference in real time. Organize it by topic (e.g., XSS, Broken Access Control, Prototype Pollution, GraphQL flaws, etc.) and for each include:

1. **Quick Concept Summary** – One or two sentences
    
2. **Step-by-Step Test Strategy** – A concise checklist of how to confirm, exploit, and validate the issue
    
3. **Essential Commands & Payloads** – Exact syntax I can copy-paste
    
4. **Tools & Flags** – Which tool, module, or Burp extension to use and with what options
    
5. **Pitfalls & Exam Hints** – Common mistakes, gotchas, and any insider tips from the course
    

The guide must be ultra-practical, zero fluff, and formatted so I can scan it instantly during the exam. Let me know when you’re ready, then I’ll send my notes.
