## **Deepening Your Understanding of Prototype Pollution**

> [!info]  
> **Overview**  
> This section explores how to deepen your knowledge of prototype pollution and other vulnerabilities by regularly reviewing research, reports, CTF write-ups, and reproducing exploits in lab environments. The goal is to build long-term habits for continuous improvement in your security expertise.

---

### **Why This Matters**

- Consistently absorbing new information helps you stay ahead of evolving vulnerabilities.
    
- Reading white papers, research blogs, and security reports provides insight into real-world exploit paths.
    
- Even if you don’t fully understand something the first time, scanning through high-quality material builds familiarity.
    

> [!tip]  
> Set aside time regularly — daily (15–30 min) or weekly — to read security content. Friday afternoons can be great for deeper dives.

### **Case Study: Kibana Prototype Pollution**

- A now-famous blog post details how a researcher discovered and exploited a prototype pollution bug in Kibana.
    
- The blog walks through the entire process: from identifying the issue to achieving exploitation.
    
- To maximize your understanding, spin up the vulnerable Kibana version using Docker Compose and walk through the blog post step-by-step.
    

> [!tip]  
> Reproducing real-world exploits in a controlled environment helps solidify your knowledge far more than just reading passively.

### **Building a Research Habit**

- Not every report requires hours of study. Some are valuable even when skimmed.
    
- Maintain a backlog of research articles, blog posts, or GitHub repos to revisit when time allows.
    
- These can be explored in depth during scheduled research blocks.

### **Where to Find Valuable Content**

#### **1. Search Engines**

- Google is effective for finding general information, especially when you're starting a new topic.
    
- Be critical of your sources — not all top results are high quality.
    

#### **2. Researchers and Original Creators**

- Follow individuals who publish their own findings and breakdowns.
    
- They often share detailed, technically accurate insights — not just summaries.
    

> [!warning]  
> Avoid social media accounts that repost everything without commentary or analysis. These accounts often chase engagement, not quality.

#### **3. PortSwigger**

- Visit [portswigger.net/research](https://portswigger.net/research) for high-quality articles aimed at engineers and researchers.
    
- Avoid the `/blog` section for deep technical content — it's often targeted toward non-technical audiences.
    

#### **4. Critical Thinking Bug Bounty Podcast**

- Shares useful write-ups and articles through YouTube and LinkedIn.
    
- Provides actionable insights with referenced blog posts.
    

#### **5. Bug Bounty Reports Explained**

- A paid yearly subscription that analyzes real bug bounty reports.
    
- Offers commentary, technical breakdowns, and links to references.
    

> [!tip]  
> Even if you don’t actively participate in bug bounty programs, reading these reports shows you what vulnerabilities are making it into production.

### **The Value of CTF Write-ups**

- CTFs (Capture the Flag) often explore edge cases and novel exploitation techniques.
    
- Write-ups can teach you attack paths and technical nuances not found in traditional labs.
    
- They’re particularly useful when working through more advanced or obscure vulnerabilities.
    

> [!important]  
> Many CTF challenges are inspired by real-world findings. Even if they're abstract, they help build creativity in approaching security problems.

### **Key Takeaways**

1. Make time to read research regularly, whether casually or in-depth.
    
2. Reproduce exploits from write-ups using Docker or local VMs.
    
3. Prioritize resources written by hands-on researchers or organizations like PortSwigger.
    
4. Maintain a backlog of high-quality articles to work through over time.
    
5. Use CTF write-ups to explore edge cases and advanced exploitation paths.
